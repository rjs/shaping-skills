# Shape Parts

## Flagged Unknown (⚠️)

A mechanism can be described at a high level without being concretely understood. The **Flag** column tracks this:

| Part | Mechanism | Flag |
|------|-----------|:----:|
| **F1** | Create widget (component, def, register) | |
| **F2** | Magic authentication handler | ⚠️ |

- **Empty** = mechanism is understood — we know concretely how to build it
- **⚠️** = flagged unknown — we've described WHAT but don't yet know HOW

**Why flagged unknowns fail the fit check:**

1. **✅ is a claim of knowledge** — it means "we know how this shape satisfies this requirement"
2. **Satisfaction requires a mechanism** — some part that concretely delivers the requirement
3. **A flag means we don't know how** — we've described what we want, not how to build it
4. **You can't claim what you don't know** — therefore it must be ❌

Fit check is always binary — ✅ or ❌ only. There is no third state. A flagged unknown is a failure until resolved.

This distinguishes "we have a sketch" from "we actually know how to do this." Early shapes (A, B, C) often have many flagged parts — that's fine for exploration. But a selected shape should have no flags (all ❌ resolved), or explicit spikes to resolve them.

## Parts Must Be Mechanisms

Shape parts describe what we BUILD or CHANGE — not intentions or constraints:

- ✅ "Route `childType === 'letter'` to `typesenseService.rawSearch()`" (mechanism)
- ❌ "Types unchanged" (constraint — belongs in R)

## Avoid Tautologies Between R and S

**R** states the need/constraint (what outcome). **S** describes the mechanism (how to achieve it). If they say the same thing, the shape part isn't adding information.

- ❌ R17: "Admins can bulk request members to sign" + C6.3: "Admin can bulk request members to sign"
- ✅ R17: "Admins can bring existing members into waiver tracking" + C6.3: "Bulk request UI with member filters, creates WaiverRequests in batch"

The requirement describes the capability needed. The shape part describes the concrete mechanism that provides it. If you find yourself copying text from R into S, stop — the shape part should add specificity about *how*.

## Parts Should Be Vertical Slices

Avoid horizontal layers like "Data model" that group all tables together. Instead, co-locate data models with the features they support:

- ❌ **B4: Data model** — Waivers table, WaiverSignatures table, WaiverRequests table
- ✅ **B1: Signing handler** — includes WaiverSignatures table + handler logic
- ✅ **B5: Request tracking** — includes WaiverRequests table + tracking logic

Each part should be a vertical slice containing the mechanism AND the data it needs.

## Extract Shared Logic

When the same logic appears in multiple parts, extract it as a standalone part that others reference:

- ❌ Duplicating "Signing handler: create WaiverSignature + set boolean" in B1 and B2
- ✅ Extract as **B1: Signing handler**, then B2 and B3 say "→ calls B1"

```markdown
| **B1** | **Signing handler** |
| B1.1 | WaiverSignatures table: memberId, waiverId, signedAt |
| B1.2 | Handler: create WaiverSignature + set member.waiverUpToDate = true |
| **B2** | **Self-serve signing** |
| B2 | Self-serve purchase: click to sign inline → calls B1 |
| **B3** | **POS signing via email** |
| B3.1 | POS purchase: send waiver email |
| B3.2 | Passwordless link to sign → calls B1 |
```

## Hierarchical Notation

Start with flat notation (E1, E2, E3...). Only introduce hierarchy (E1.1, E1.2...) when:

- There are too many parts to easily understand
- You're reaching a conclusion and want to show structure
- Grouping related mechanisms aids communication

| Notation | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| E1 | Top-level component of shape E |
| E1.1, E1.2 | Sub-parts of E1 (add later if needed) |

Example of hierarchical grouping (used when shape is mature):

| Part | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **E1** | **Swap data source** |
| E1.1 | Modify backend indexer |
| E1.2 | Route letters to new service |
| E1.3 | Route posts to new service |
| **E2** | **Add search input** |
| E2.1 | Add input with debounce |
